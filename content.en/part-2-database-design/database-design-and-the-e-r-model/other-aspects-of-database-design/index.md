# Other Aspects of Database Design

Our extensive discussion of schema design in this chapter may create the false impression that schema design is the only component of a database design. There are indeed several other considerations that we address more fully in subsequent chapters, and survey briefly here.

## Data Constraints and Relational Database Design

We have seen a variety of data constraints that can be expressed using SQL, including primary-key constraints, foreign-key constraints, **check** constraints, assertions, and triggers. Constraints serve several purposes. The most obvious one is the automation of consistency preservation. By expressing constraints in the SQL data-definition language, the designer is able to ensure that the database system itself enforces the constraints. This is more reliable than relying on each application program individually to enforce constraints. It also provides a central location for the update of constraints and the addition of new ones.

A further advantage of stating constraints explicitly is that certain constraints are particularly useful in designing relational database schemas. If we know, for example, that a social-security number uniquely identifies a person, then we can use a person’s social-security number to link data related to that person even if these data appear in multiple relations. Contrast that with, for example, eye color, which is not a unique identifier. Eye color could not be used to link data pertaining to a specific person across relations because that person’s data could not be distinguished from data pertaining to other people with the same eye color.

In Section 7.6, we generated a set of relation schemas for a given E-R design using the constraints specified in the design. In Chapter 8, we formalize this idea and related ones, and show how they can assist in the design of relational database schemas. The formal approach to relational database design allows us to state in a precise manner when a given design is a good one and to transform poor designs into better ones. We shall see that the process of starting with an entity-relationship design and generating relation schemas algorithmically from that design provides a good start to the design process.

Data constraints are useful as well in determining the physical structure of data. It may be useful to store data that are closely related to each other in physical proximity on disk so as to gain efficiencies in disk access. Certain index structures work better when the index is on a primary key.

Constraint enforcement comes at a potentially high price in performance each time the database is updated. For each update, the system must check all of the constraints and either reject updates that fail the constraints or execute appropriate triggers. The significance of the performance penalty depends not only on the frequency of update but also on how the database is designed. Indeed efficiency of the testing of certain types of constraints is an important aspect of the discussion of relational database schema design in Chapter 8.

## Usage Requirements: Queries, Performance

Database system performance is a critical aspect of most enterprise information systems. Performance pertains not only to the efficient use of the computing and storage hardware being used, but also to the efficiency of people who interact with the system and of processes that depend upon database data.

There are two main metrics for performance:

• **Throughput**—the number of queries or updates (often referred to as _trans- actions_) that can be processed on average per unit of time.

• **Response time**—the amount of time a _single_ transaction takes from start to finish in either the average case or the worst case.

Systems that process large numbers of transactions in a batch style focus on having high throughput. Systems that interact with people or time-critical systems often focus on response time. These two metrics are not equivalent. High throughput arises from obtaining high utilization of system components. Doing so may result in certain transactions being delayed until such time that they can be run more efficiently. Those delayed transactions suffer poor response time.

Most commercial database systems historically have focused on throughput; however, a variety of applications including Web-based applications and telecom- munication information systems require good response time on average and a reasonable bound on worst-case response time.

An understanding of types of queries that are expected to be the most frequent helps in the design process. Queries that involve joins require more resources to evaluate than those that do not. In cases where a join is required, the database administrator may choose to create an index that facilitates evaluation of that join. For queries—whether a join is involved or not—indices can be created to speed evaluation of selection predicates (SQL **where** clause) that are likely to appear.  

Another aspect of queries that affects the choice of indices is the relative mix of update and read operations. While an index may speed queries, it also slows updates, which are forced to do extra work to maintain the accuracy of the index.

## Authorization Requirements

Authorization constraints affect design of the database as well because SQL allows access to be granted to users on the basis of components of the logical design of the database. A relation schema may need to be decomposed into two or more schemas to facilitate the granting of access rights in SQL. For example, an employee record may include data relating to payroll, job functions, and medical benefits. Because different administrative units of the enterprise may manage each of these types of data, some users will need access to payroll data while being denied access to the job data, medical data, etc. If these data are all in one relation, the desired division of access, though still feasible through the use of views, is more cumbersome. Division of data in this manner becomes even more critical when the data are distributed across systems in a computer network, an issue we consider in Chapter 19.

## Data Flow, Workflow

Database applications are often part of a larger enterprise application that in- teracts not only with the database system but also with various specialized ap- plications. For example, in a manufacturing company, a computer-aided design (CAD) system may assist in the design of new products. The CAD system may extract data from the database via an SQL statement, process the data internally, perhaps interacting with a product designer, and then update the database. Dur- ing this process, control of the data may pass among several product designers as well as other people. As another example, consider a travel-expense report. It is created by an employee returning from a business trip (possibly by means of a special software package) and is subsequently routed to the employee’s manager, perhaps other higher-level managers, and eventually to the accounting depart- ment for payment (at which point it interacts with the enterprise’s accounting information systems).

The term _workflow_ refers to the combination of data and tasks involved in pro- cesses like those of the preceding examples. Workflows interact with the database system as they move among users and users perform their tasks on the workflow. In addition to the data on which workflows operate, the database may store data about the workflow itself, including the tasks making up a workflow and how they are to be routed among users. Workflows thus specify a series of queries and updates to the database that may be taken into account as part of the database- design process. Put in other terms, modeling the enterprise requires us not only to understand the semantics of the data but also the business processes that use those data.  

## Issues in Database Design

Database design is usually not a one-time activity. The needs of an organization evolve continually, and the data that it needs to store also evolve correspond- ingly. During the initial database-design phases, or during the development of an application, the database designer may realize that changes are required at the conceptual, logical, or physical schema levels. Changes in the schema can affect all aspects of the database application. A good database design anticipates future needs of an organization, and ensures that the schema requires minimal changes as the needs evolve.

It is important to distinguish between fundamental constraints that are ex- pected to be permanent and constraints that are anticipated to change. For exam- ple, the constraint that an instructor-id identify a unique instructor is fundamen- tal. On the other hand, a university may have a policy that an instructor can have only one department, which may change at a later date if joint appointments are allowed. A database design that only allows one department per instructor might require major changes if joint appointments are allowed. Such joint appointments can be represented by adding an extra relationship, without modifying the _in- structor_ relation, as long as each instructor has only one primary department affiliation; a policy change that allows more than one primary affiliation may require a larger change in the database design. A good design should account not only for current policies, but should also avoid or minimize changes due to changes that are anticipated, or have a reasonable chance of happening.

Furthermore, the enterprise that the database is serving likely interacts with other enterprises and, therefore, multiple databases may need to interact. Con- version of data between different schemas is an important problem in real-world applications. Various solutions have been proposed for this problem. The XML data model, which we study in Chapter 23, is widely used for representing data when it is exchanged between different applications.

Finally, it is worth noting that database design is a human-oriented activity in two senses: the end users of the system are people (even if an application sits between the database and the end users); and the database designer needs to interact extensively with experts in the application domain to understand the data requirements of the application. All of the people involved with the data have needs and preferences that should be taken into account in order for a database design and deployment to succeed within the enterprise.
