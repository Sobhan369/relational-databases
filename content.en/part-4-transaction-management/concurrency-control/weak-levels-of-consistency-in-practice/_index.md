# Weak Levels of Consistency in Practice

In Section 14.5, we discussed the isolation levels specified by the SQL standard: serializable, repeatable read, read committed, and read uncommitted. In this section, we first briefly outline some older terminology relating to consistency levels weaker than serializability and relate it to the SQL standard levels. We then discuss the issue of concurrency control for transactions that involve user interaction, an issue that we briefly discussed earlier in Section 14.8.

## Degree-Two Consistency

The purpose of **degree-two consistency** is to avoid cascading aborts without nec- essarily ensuring serializability. The locking protocol for degree-two consistency uses the same two lock modes that we used for the two-phase locking protocol: shared (S) and exclusive (X). A transaction must hold the appropriate lock mode when it accesses a data item, but two-phase behavior is not required.

In contrast to the situation in two-phase locking, S-locks may be released at any time, and locks may be acquired at any time. Exclusive locks, however,

3The term _predicate locking_ was used for a version of the protocol that used shared and exclusive locks on predicates, and was thus more complicated. The version we present here, with only shared locks on predicates, is also referred to as **precision locking**.

cannot be released until the transaction either commits or aborts. Serializability is not ensured by this protocol. Indeed, a transaction may read the same data item twice and obtain different results. In Figure 15.20, _T_32 reads the value of _Q_ before and after that value is written by _T_33.

Clearly, reads are not repeatable, but since exclusive locks are held until transaction commit, no transaction can read an uncommitted value. Thus, degree- two consistency is one particular implementation of the read-committed isolation level.

## Cursor Stability

**Cursor stability** is a form of degree-two consistency designed for programs that iterate over tuples of a relation by using cursors. Instead of locking the entire relation, cursor stability ensures that:

• The tuple that is currently being processed by the iteration is locked in shared mode.

• Any modified tuples are locked in exclusive mode until the transaction com- mits.

These rules ensure that degree-two consistency is obtained. Two-phase lock- ing is not required. Serializability is not guaranteed. Cursor stability is used in practice on heavily accessed relations as a means of increasing concurrency and improving system performance. Applications that use cursor stability must be coded in a way that ensures database consistency despite the possibility of non- serializable schedules. Thus, the use of cursor stability is limited to specialized situations with simple consistency constraints.

## Concurrency Control Across User Interactions

Concurrency-control protocols usually consider transactions that do not involve user interaction. Consider the airline seat selection example from Section 14.8,  


which involved user interaction. Suppose we treat all the steps from when the seat availability is initially shown to the user, till the seat selection is confirmed, as a single transaction.

If two-phase locking is used, the entire set of seats on a flight would be locked in shared mode till the user has completed the seat selection, and no other transaction would be able to update the seat allocation information in this period. Clearly such locking would be a very bad idea since a user may take a long time to make a selection, or even just abandon the transaction without explicitly cancelling it. Timestamp protocols or validation could be used instead, which avoid the problem of locking, but both these protocols would abort the transaction for a user _A_ if any other user _B_ has updated the seat allocation information, even if the seat selected by _B_ does not conflict with the seat selected by user _A_. Snapshot isolation is a good option in this situation, since it would not abort the transaction of user _A_ as long as _B_ did not select the same seat as _A_.

However, snapshot isolation requires the database to remember information about updates performed by a transaction even after it has committed, as long as any other concurrent transaction is still active, which can be problematic for long duration transactions.

Another option is to split a transaction that involves user interaction into two or more transactions, such that no transaction spans a user interaction. If our seat selection transaction is split thus, the first transaction would read the seat availability, while the second transaction would complete the allocation of the selected seat. If the second transaction is written carelessly, it could assign the selected seat to the user, without checking if the seat was meanwhile assigned to some other user, resulting in a lost-update problem. To avoid the problem, as we outlined in Section 14.8, the second transaction should perform the seat allocation only if the seat was not meanwhile assigned to some other user.

The above idea has been generalized in an alternative concurrency control scheme, which uses version numbers stored in tuples to avoid lost updates. The schema of each relation is altered by adding an extra _version number_ attribute, which is initialized to 0 when the tuple is created. When a transaction reads (for the first time) a tuple that it intends to update, it remembers the version number of that tuple. The read is performed as a stand-alone transaction on the database, and hence any locks that may be obtained are released immediately. Updates are done locally, and copied to the database as part of commit processing, using the following steps which are executed atomically (that is, as part of a single database transaction):

• For each updated tuple, the transaction checks if the current version number is the same as the version number of the tuple when it was first read by the transaction.

**1\.** If the version numbers match, the update is performed on the tuple in the database, and its version number is incremented by 1.

**2\.** If the version numbers do not match, the transaction is aborted, rolling back all the updates it performed.  


If the version number check succeeds for all updated tuples, the transaction commits. It is worth noting that a timestamp could be used instead of the version number, without impacting the scheme in any way.

Observe the close similarity between the above scheme and snapshot isola- tion. The version number check implements the first-committer-wins rule used in snapshot isolation, and can be used even if the transaction was active for a very long time. However, unlike snapshot isolation, the reads performed by transaction may not correspond to a snapshot of the database; and unlike the validation-based protocol, reads performed by the transaction are not validated.

We refer to the above scheme as **optimistic concurrency control without read validation**. Optimistic concurrency control without read validation provides a weak level of serializability, and does not ensure serializability. A variant of this scheme uses version numbers to validate reads at the time of commit, in addition to validating writes, to ensure that the tuples read by the transaction were not updated subsequent to the initial read; this scheme is equivalent to the optimistic concurrency-control scheme which we saw earlier.

The above scheme has been widely used by application developers to handle transactions that involve user interaction. An attractive feature of the scheme is that it can be implemented easily on top of a database system. The validation and update steps performed as part of commit processing are then executed as a single transaction in the database, using the concurrency-control scheme of the database to ensure atomicity for commit processing. The above scheme is also used by the Hibernate object-relational mapping system (Section 9.4.2), and other object- relational mapping systems, where it is referred to as optimistic concurrency control (even though reads are not validated by default). Transactions that involve user interaction are called **conversations** in Hibernate to differentiate them from regular transactions validation using version numbers is very useful for such transactions. Object-relational mapping systems also cache database tuples in the form of objects in memory, and execute transactions on the cached objects; updates on the objects are converted into updates on the database when the transaction commits. Data may remain in cache for a long time, and if transactions update such cached data, there is a risk of lost updates. Hibernate and other object-relational mapping systems therefore perform the version number checks transparently as part of commit processing. (Hibernate allows programmers to bypass the cache and execute transactions directly on the database, if serializability is desired.)
