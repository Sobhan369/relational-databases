# Database Buffer

A major goal of the database system is to minimize the number of block transfers between the disk and memory. One way to reduce the number of disk accesses is to keep as many blocks as possible in main memory. The goal is to maximize the chance that, when a block is accessed, it is already in main memory, and, thus, no disk access is required.

Since it is not possible to keep all blocks in main memory, we need to manage the allocation of the space available in main memory for the storage of blocks. The **buffer** is that part of main memory available for storage of copies of disk blocks. There is always a copy kept on disk of every block, but the copy on disk may be a version of the block older than the version in the buffer. The subsystem responsible for the allocation of buffer space is called the **buffer manager**.

## Buffer Manager
Programs in a database system make requests (that is, calls) on the buffer manager when they need a block from disk. If the block is already in the buffer, the buffer manager passes the address of the block in main memory to the requester. If the block is not in the buffer, the buffer manager first allocates space in the buffer for the block, throwing out some other block, if necessary, to make space for the new block. The thrown-out block is written back to disk only if it has been modified since the most recent time that it was written to the disk. Then, the buffer manager reads in the requested block from the disk to the buffer, and passes the address of the block in main memory to the requester. The internal actions of the buffer manager are transparent to the programs that issue disk-block requests.

If you are familiar with operating-system concepts, you will note that the buffer manager appears to be nothing more than a virtual-memory manager, like those found in most operating systems. One difference is that the size of the database might be larger than the hardware address space of a machine, so memory addresses are not sufficient to address all disk blocks. Further, to serve the database system well, the buffer manager must use techniques more sophisticated than typical virtual-memory management schemes:

- **Buffer replacement strategy**. When there is no room left in the buffer, a block must be removed from the buffer before a new one can be read in. Most operating systems use a **least recently used** (**LRU**) scheme, in which the block that was referenced least recently is written back to disk and is removed from the buffer. This simple approach can be improved on for database applications.

- **Pinned blocks**. For the database system to be able to recover from crashes (Chapter 16), it is necessary to restrict those times when a block may be written back to disk. For instance, most recovery systems require that a block should not be written to disk while an update on the block is in progress. A block that is not allowed to be written back to disk is said to be **pinned**. Although many operating systems do not support pinned blocks, such a feature is essential for a database system that is resilient to crashes.

- **Forced output of blocks**. There are situations in which it is necessary to write back the block to disk, even though the buffer space that it occupies is not needed. This write is called the **forced output** of a block. We shall see the reason for forced output in Chapter 16; briefly, main-memory contents and thus buffer contents are lost in a crash, whereas data on disk usually survive a crash.

## Buffer-Replacement Policies

The goal of a replacement strategy for blocks in the buffer is to minimize accesses to the disk. For general-purpose programs, it is not possible to predict accurately which blocks will be referenced. Therefore, operating systems use the past pattern of block references as a predictor of future references. The assumption generally made is that blocks that have been referenced recently are likely to be referenced again. Therefore, if a block must be replaced, the least recently referenced block is replaced. This approach is called the **least recently used** (**LRU**) block-replacement scheme.  

```
for each tuple i of instructor do
    for each tuple d of department do
        if i[dept name] = d[dept name]
        then begin
                let x be a tuple defined as follows:
                x[ID] := i[ID]
                x[dept name] := i[dept name]
                x[name] := i[name]
                x[salary] := i[salary]
                x[building] := d[building]
                x[budget] := d[budget]
                include tuple x as part of result of instructor ✶ department
            end
    end
end
```

**Figure 10.17** Procedure for computing join.

LRU is an acceptable replacement scheme in operating systems. However, a database system is able to predict the pattern of future references more accurately than an operating system. A user request to the database system involves several steps. The database system is often able to determine in advance which blocks will be needed by looking at each of the steps required to perform the user- requested operation. Thus, unlike operating systems, which must rely on the past to predict the future, database systems may have information regarding at least the short-term future.

To illustrate how information about future block access allows us to improve the LRU strategy, consider the processing of the SQL query:

**select** \* 
**from** _instructor_ **natural join** _department_;

Assume that the strategy chosen to process this request is given by the pseu- docode program shown in Figure 10.17. (We shall study other, more efficient, strategies in Chapter 12.)

Assume that the two relations of this example are stored in separate files. In this example, we can see that, once a tuple of _instructor_ has been processed, that tuple is not needed again. Therefore, once processing of an entire block of _instructor_ tuples is completed, that block is no longer needed in main memory, even though it has been used recently. The buffer manager should be instructed to free the space occupied by an _instructor_ block as soon as the final tuple has been processed. This buffer-management strategy is called the **toss-immediate** strategy.

Now consider blocks containing _department_ tuples. We need to examine every block of _department_ tuples once for each tuple of the _instructor_ relation. When processing of a _department_ block is completed, we know that that block will not be accessed again until all other _department_ blocks have been processed. Thus, the most recently used _department_ block will be the final block to be re-referenced, and the least recently used _department_ block is the block that will be referenced next. This assumption set is the exact opposite of the one that forms the basis for the LRU strategy. Indeed, the optimal strategy for block replacement for the above procedure is the **most recently used** (**MRU**) strategy. If a _department_ block must be removed from the buffer, the MRU strategy chooses the most recently used block (blocks are not eligible for replacement while they are being used).

For the MRU strategy to work correctly for our example, the system must pin the _department_ block currently being processed. After the final _department_ tuple has been processed, the block is unpinned, and it becomes the most recently used block.

In addition to using knowledge that the system may have about the request being processed, the buffer manager can use statistical information about the probability that a request will reference a particular relation. For example, the data dictionary that (as we will see in detail in Section 10.7) keeps track of the logical schema of the relations as well as their physical storage information is one of the most frequently accessed parts of the database. Thus, the buffer manager should try not to remove data-dictionary blocks from main memory, unless other factors dictate that it do so. In Chapter 11, we discuss indices for files. Since an index for a file may be accessed more frequently than the file itself, the buffer manager should, in general, not remove index blocks from main memory if alternatives are available.

The ideal database block-replacement strategy needs knowledge of the data- base operations—both those being performed and those that will be performed in the future. No single strategy is known that handles all the possible scenarios well. Indeed, a surprisingly large number of database systems use LRU, despite that strategy’s faults. The practice questions and exercises explore alternative strategies.

The strategy that the buffer manager uses for block replacement is influenced by factors other than the time at which the block will be referenced again. If the system is processing requests by several users concurrently, the concurrency- control subsystem (Chapter 15) may need to delay certain requests, to ensure preservation of database consistency. If the buffer manager is given informa- tion from the concurrency-control subsystem indicating which requests are being delayed, it can use this information to alter its block-replacement strategy. Specif- ically, blocks needed by active (nondelayed) requests can be retained in the buffer at the expense of blocks needed by the delayed requests.

The crash-recovery subsystem (Chapter 16) imposes stringent constraints on block replacement. If a block has been modified, the buffer manager is not allowed to write back the new version of the block in the buffer to disk, since that would destroy the old version. Instead, the block manager must seek permission from the crash-recovery subsystem before writing out a block. The crash-recovery subsystem may demand that certain other blocks be force-output before it grants permission to the buffer manager to output the block requested. In Chapter 16, we define precisely the interaction between the buffer manager and the crash- recovery subsystem.
